# Environmental Impacts of Oil Imports to Bay Area Refineries

This project is a data visualization of the flows of oil from around the world to refineries in the San Francisco Bay Area.
The intent is to make the changes in carbon emissions related to the various crude oil grades from each country of import and
compare that to the changes in air polutants regulated by the Bay Area Air Quality Manangement Board (BAAQMD).

The thesis, based on scientific papers, commissioned by BAAQMD itself, from the [Union of Concerned Scientists](http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/global_warming/oil-refinery-CO2-performance.pdf)    and the staff's
own proposed [rule 12-16](http://www.baaqmd.gov/~/media/files/planning-and-research/rules-and-regs/workshops/2015/1215-1216-workshop/1215_1216_fs_022715.pdf)
                         , is that the driving factors for carbon emissions are separate and independent of those that produce
other air pollutants known as [criteria air pollutants (CAP)](http://www.baaqmd.gov/research-and-data/emission-inventory/criteria-air-pollutants)                                     [and toxic air contaminants](http://www.baaqmd.gov/research-and-data/air-toxics). 

<!--
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
